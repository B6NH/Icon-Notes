Note that we convert one of the items in the division to a real number (i.e., one with a decimal point) so
that the result will be precise. If arithmetic functions are performed on numbers of which at least one is
real, the answer will be real. The function real() converts an integer, or a string if feasible, into a real
number. One question arises. What would happen if the file were empty? It might appear that we
should divide by zero and thereby cause a run-time error. In point of fact there is no problem, because
getword() will fail as soon as it is called, with the result that printout() will not be called at all.
However, this is something to watch for. It is always a good idea to test a program by offering it
unusual data, such as an empty file.
